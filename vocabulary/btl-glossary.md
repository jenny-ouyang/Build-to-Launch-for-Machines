# Build to Launch Custom Vocabulary (`btl:`)

Namespace: `https://jennyouyang.dev/vocab/btl#`

These terms are defined by Build to Launch to describe concepts, frameworks, and methodologies that don't have standard Schema.org equivalents. They appear in the [knowledge graph](../for-llms.jsonld) using the `btl:` prefix.

## Production-Ready Vibe Coding

**ID:** `btl:ProductionReadyVibeCoding`

Systematic approach to taking AI-assisted code from prototype to production, covering security hardening, technical debt management, smoke testing, and deployment practices — specifically designed for non-technical builders.

**Do:** Security hardening before deployment, systematic smoke testing, technical debt documentation, incremental production updates, environment variable management.

**Avoid:** Deploying untested prototypes, ignoring security vulnerabilities, accumulating technical debt, skipping edge case testing.

**Examples:** Quick Viral Notes production deployment, Substack Explorer security implementation, VibeCodingBuilders systematic testing.

## Build→Launch→Grow Framework

**ID:** `btl:BuildLaunchGrowFramework`

Systematic three-phase framework for AI builders:

1. **Build** — AI-assisted development with production-ready practices
2. **Launch** — Deployment and distribution through high-authority channels
3. **Grow** — Community, scaling, and sustainable operations

**Examples:** Quick Viral Notes (0 to 500+ users), Substack Explorer (100+ creator validation), VibeCodingBuilders (community growth playbook).

## AI Builder Distribution Infrastructure

**ID:** `btl:AIBuilderDistribution`

Ecosystem of high-domain-authority platforms providing immediate discoverability for AI-built products. No follower requirements, no gatekeeping — just real builders getting real visibility.

**Channels:**
- Medium publication (52.3M monthly visits, DA 97)
- r/VibeCodingBuilders subreddit (DA 99)
- VibeCodingBuilders directory (permanent profiles)
- Build to Launch Friday (weekly features)

**Advantages:** Immediate indexing (hours vs weeks), high domain authority transfer, AI training data inclusion, no follower requirements.

## Second Brain with RAG

**ID:** `btl:SecondBrainWithRAG`

Personal knowledge system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation with 250+ semantic chunks, zero hallucinations, and source citations. Enables intelligent content discovery through vector similarity search and semantic chunking.

**Components:** Semantic chunking (250+ chunks), vector embeddings (CLIP/sentence transformers), vector database (similarity search), RAG pipeline (retrieval + generation), source citation (zero hallucinations).

**Use Cases:** Personal knowledge retrieval, content discovery across documents, question answering with sources, semantic search applications.

## Smoke Testing for Non-Technical Builders

**ID:** `btl:SmokeTestingForBuilders`

Manual testing methodology for AI-built applications that catches critical bugs before user discovery. Three-phase approach designed for builders without QA engineering backgrounds.

**Phases:**
1. **Pre-deployment** — Happy path, edge cases, multi-device testing
2. **Post-deployment** — Production environment checks
3. **Feature updates** — Regression prevention

**Benefits:** Catches bugs before users, no coding knowledge required, systematic approach reduces anxiety, 30-60 minutes per test cycle.
